            <p>HTC introduced its Verizon ReZound handset and wanted a mobile site to show off the phone, on the phone. We customized a jQuery Mobile Framework site and threw in some cool extras. Like a 360 view of the phone that's rotated with the touch screen.</p>

            <h3>Asynchronous HTML5 Video Facebook App for Bare Escentuals Cosmetics, Be a Force of Beauty&trade;</h3>
            <p>Bare Escentuals Cosmetics needed a Facebook app that would tie in with their Be a Force of Beauty&trade;. With seven video segments, it made
                sense to build a video channel. We seized the opportunity to use the built-in video capabilities of the new browsers.</p>

            <p>Right around the time the iPad came out, people at Disney Family.com started to realize they were going to
                have to do something about their Flash-driven content. We were able to reverse-engineer the "feature carousel"
                that sits in the center well of the kaboose.com home page. The seamless transition was accomplished using
                the YUI library.</p>
