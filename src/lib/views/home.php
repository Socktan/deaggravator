    <h3>Info</h3>
    <p>We operate in the sizable gap left between the amateur design shop and the larger corporate
        agencies. Our projects might be a single-page brochure web site or a complex database-driven commerce
        or social media site. We take pride in being knowledgeable and friendly professionals. Our clients
        love us and they never hesitate to recommend our work.</p>

    <h3>Who</h3>
    <p>Socktan is a group of skilled digital creatives working together to provide web-centric professional
        services. Based on the Southern California coast, we aid our clients in their effort to communicate a
        message to their audience. Whether that audience is a customer, a client, or the public at large, businesses
        without web-presence are becoming an endangered species. Customers are using the
        web to find you. Trends like social media and web mobility are becoming essential to surviving in the
        marketplace.</p>
